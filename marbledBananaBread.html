	<p > This banana bread is not only visualy appealing, but also delectable. With a chocolaty bread swirling into a cinamony filling, this banana bread is sure to steal the show. (loosely adapted from Smitten Kitchen)</p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 large very ripe bananas </li>
		<li> 1/3 cup unsalted butter melted</li>
		<li> 1/2 cup  light brown sugar</li>
		<li> 2 large eggs</li>
		<li> 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
		<li> 1 tsp baking soda</li>
		<li> 1/4 tsp table or fine sea salt </li>
		<li> 1/2 cup + 2 tbs Whole wheat flour </li>
		<li> 1/2 cup + 2 tbs All purpose white flour </li>
		<li> 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
		<li> 1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
		<li> </li>
		<li> 1/4 cup dark cocoa powder sifted</li>
		<li> 1 1/2 tsp esspresso powder</li> </ul>
		<h3> Directions </h3>
		<p class="left"> 

<br>
Heat oven to 350°F. Butter a 9×5-inch loaf pan, or coat it with a nonstick baking spray.
Melt butter in the bottom of a large bowl in the microwave. Mash the bananas right into it until mostly smooth. Whisk in brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined. Add both 1/2 cups of flour and throughly mix.
<br>
<br>
Pour half of batter into a second bowl, eyeballing it Into one bowl, stir the remaining 1/4 cup of flour, nutmeg, and ground cinnamon. Into the other bowl, stir in the cocoa powder and espresso powder. 
<br>
<br>
Dollop batters in large alternating spoonfuls into bottom of prepared loaf pan (I did 3 total in each layer). Attempt to “checkerboard” the rest in, roughly meaning that you’ll drop a chocolate batter dollop on top of a chocolate-free one and vice-versa until both batters are used up. Use a butter knife or small offset spatula to make a few figure-8s through the batters, marbling them together. By a few, I mean 2-3 otherwise your batter will blend together and the beautiful swirls will be unreckognizable. 
<br>
<br>
Bake 55 to 65 minutes, until a tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free.Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and invert it out onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
Do ahead: The banana bread will keep for up to 6 days at room temperature. I keep mine wrapped in foil and heat it up in the microwave for 10-20 seconds before eating. </p>
