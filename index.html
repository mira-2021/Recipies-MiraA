	<h1> Mira's Favorite Recipies </h1>
	<p> When navigating the nebulous world of cooking, it is important to have some tried and true recipies that are always stellar no matter the day. Some of these recipies are savory, while some are sweet, some can be eaten for a specific meal, while some are more versatile, but all of them are great! All of these recipies have modifications that I have suggested, but the orrigonal recipie is my favorite of all the modifications.   </p>
