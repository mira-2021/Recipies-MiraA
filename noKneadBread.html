		<h1> No Knead Bread </h1>
	</div>
	
	<p> This is litrally the best bread ever! Its light and airy with a crunchy crust. It has endless modifications, I ususally make it 1/2 whole wheat because of personal preference, but you can add olives, raisens, make it 1/3 whole wheat. Its pretty versitile.  </p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<h4> Yeilds one 1 1/2 lb loaf </h4>
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 cups all purpose flour or bread flour. (You can sub this up to 1/2 whole wheat) </li>
		<li> 1/4 tsp instant yeast or 1/3 tsp active dry yeast </li>
		<li> 1 1/4 tsp salt</li> </ul>
		
		<h3> Directions </h3>
<p class="left"> 

In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 cup and 10-11 tbs water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

<br>
<br>Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

<br>
<br>Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

<br> 
<br>At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450Â°F. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
