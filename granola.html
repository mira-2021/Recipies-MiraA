		<h1> Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Granola </h1>
</div>
	<p> This granola is crunchy, sweet, and full of flavor. Its much better than buying your own because it is better for you, but is super simple and easy to make, but don't make it on an empty stomach otherwise the whole tray will be gone before you realize.  </p>

Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet (or more baking sheets if making a larger batch) and bake for 17-24 minutes (or until fragrant and deep golden brown), stirring a bit near the halfway point to ensure even baking.
