	<h1> Sea Salt Dark Chocolate Granola </h1>
	<p> This granola is crunchy, sweet, and full of flavor. Its much better than buying your own because it is better for you, but is super simple and easy to make, but don't make it on an empty stomach otherwise the whole tray will be gone before you realize.  </p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<ul> 
		<li> 3 cups rolled oats</li>
		<li> 1/4 cup chopped raw nuts </li>
		<li> 1 tbs chia seeds</li>
		<li> 1 tsp sea salt</li>
		<li> 1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
		<li> 3 tbs coconut oil </li>
		<li> 1/3 cup + 2 tbs maple syrup </li>
	<h3> Directions </h3>
	<p> Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (171 C).

To a or mixing bowl, add the oats, nuts, chia seeds, salt, and cocoa powder. Stirto combine.
In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the coconut oil and maple syrup until melted and combined. Pour over the dry ingredients and stir well. 
Spread the mixture evenly onto a baking sheet (or more baking sheets if making a larger batch) and bake for 17-24 minutes (or until fragrant and deep golden brown), stirring a bit near the halfway point to ensure even baking.
Let cool completely. Place in a container that has an air-tight seal, and it should keep for a few weeks. Or store in the freezer up to 1 month or longer.
